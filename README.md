## Notes

**OS Requirement**

These templates require CentOS 10 Stream operating system. You can either install CentOS 10 Stream on your local machine (Virtual Machine Dual Boot) or use a third party VPS service such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

We recommend you to use [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to setup your server. It will save much time for you.


Instead, if you want to install CentOS 10 Stream on your local machine via virtual machine, you may consider using [VMWare Workstation Pro (for Windows and Linux) or VMWare Fusion (for MacOS)](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
